bender: Bender is a futuristic robot from the TV show Futurama and is voiced by John DiMaggio. Bender was created as a bending unit, designed to bend steel girders with his bare hands. He runs on alcohol and smokes because it "makes him look cool." He is very rude and often makes fun of others around him, even close friends.
